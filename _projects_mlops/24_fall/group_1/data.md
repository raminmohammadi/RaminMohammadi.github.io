## Dataset Information

The dataset we will work with consists of reviews and metadata for video games and toys sourced from a comprehensive collection of Amazon product reviews. This dataset serves a crucial purpose for our eCommerce chatbot project by providing valuable insights into customer experiences, preferences, and sentiments regarding our products. Analyzing this data can enhance the chatbotâ€™s ability to respond to user inquiries with relevant and context-specific information.

The relevance of this dataset lies in its ability to inform our understanding of customer opinions and trends within the video game and toy markets. We can create a more dynamic and interactive shopping experience by leveraging the review and metadata components. The reviews provide qualitative insights, while the metadata offers essential product details such as categories, ratings, and pricing information, which are integral to answering user queries accurately.

Using this dataset will also enable us to implement a more intelligent retrieval system that enhances the user experience by allowing personalized interactions based on past customer feedback and product attributes. This dual approach will increase customer satisfaction and help drive sales by providing users with the information they need to make informed purchasing decisions.

### 2. Data Rights and Privacy

The dataset utilized in this project is governed by the MIT License, which provides flexibility in terms of usage, modification, and distribution with minimal restrictions. However, as part of our research, it is crucial to address data rights and privacy, particularly given the user-generated content involved, such as reviews and identifiers like user_id and timestamp. While the MIT License grants broad permissions, we have taken steps to ensure compliance with data protection regulations, including the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). This involves anonymizing or pseudonymizing personally identifiable information (PII) to safeguard users' privacy and mitigate the risk of sensitive data being misused. Additionally, we have ensured that the data handling practices align with the relevant privacy standards to uphold ethical research principles and maintain the integrity of user data throughout the project.

## Data Pipeline

The data pipeline is designed to process large JSON files into a structured schema and we employed [Apache Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/)
* [MLflow](https://mlflow.org/) to modularize our data pipeline.
