Hi, I’m Rahul! I’m currently pursuing a Master’s in Data Analytics at Northeastern University in Boston, where I have the opportunity to explore the many dimensions of math and data, a field I’m passionate about. My areas of interest include statistical methods, machine learning, NLP, and MLOps, each of which equips me to make a meaningful impact in this vast world.

Before grad school, I worked as a Quantitative Analyst, developing alpha models across a variety of markets and regions. That experience ignited my drive to blend math, machine learning, and scientific thinking to tackle real-world challenges in impactful ways.

Outside the world of data and tech, you’ll probably find me out in nature. I love exploring outdoors, seeking out new adventures, and taking in the calm of a quiet sunset. Currently trying to remember where I saved all those organized files!
