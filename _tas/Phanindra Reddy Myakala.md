I\'m a Master of Science candidate in Data Analytics Engineering at
Northeastern University, Boston, MA, and currently serve as a Graduate
Teaching Assistant, where I enjoy delving into the intricate
mathematical aspects of Machine Learning and facilitating student
understanding. My academic and project undertakings, including
innovative initiatives like \"Holographic Classrooms\" and predictive
models for healthcare data, exemplify my dedication to the field. For
those interested in a comprehensive overview of my projects and
experiences, my [LinkedIn](	https://www.linkedin.com/in/myakala-phanindra-reddy) profile is the best resource. Outside of
academics and professional endeavors, I have a penchant for movies and
music.
