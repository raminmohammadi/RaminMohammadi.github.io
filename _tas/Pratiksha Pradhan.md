I am a second year master\'s student in Data Analytics Engineering at
Northeastern University. I have a deep interest in the applications of
data science and machine learning in the healthcare/medical domain,
specifically related to identifying bias in this field. I am currently
working on a related project in collaboration with the Lab for
Computational Physiology at MIT. During my free time, I love to read,
binge-watch show/movies, dance, and try out new experiences and food
around Boston.

I am excited to be working as a Teaching Assistant for Statistical
Learning for Engineering for Fall 2023. Please feel free to reach out to
me regarding the course or any projects/collaborations.
