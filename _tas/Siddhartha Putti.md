Hello folks,

I'm a Northeastern Alumni '23. I'm very good at OverWatch 2, Rainbow 6.  My favourite anime are Bleach and DeathNote, and yes I watched Naruto, One Piece and a ton.  

My Super Skill? give me 20mins, I can beat you in any video game! JUST KIDDING give me 10mins.

Fav character? Zaraki from Bleach and Pain from Naruto. I really love how Zaraki never fight for anyone, he sticks to what he believe and he throughly enjoys what he does. Sounds more like me :).  I highly recommend watching Bleach!

Oh and professional career? I build ML/NLP systems for fun and 'NO, DO NOT' contact me for study/academic/technical realted, I do enough technical stuff at work.

Happy Machine Learning.

I SUPPORT THANOS!
