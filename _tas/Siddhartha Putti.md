I am a second-year master's student at Northeastern University. I am extremely fortunate to work as Teaching Assistant for the course  Machine Learning(IE7374). 

I am an experienced software developer interested in deep learning architectures.  I am currently working on levelling up my skills with CUDA accelerated Pytorch along with NVIDIA profiler on SOTA neural networks. Feel 
free  to reach out with any project ideas/collaborations for the same. I am also  broadly interested in un/supervised machine learning and computer vision.
