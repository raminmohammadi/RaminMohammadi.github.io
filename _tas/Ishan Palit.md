I am a second year master's student in the Data Analytics Engineering program at Northeastern University, Boston. I have previously worked as a Data Science & Analytics Associate at PwC India in multiple projects
spanning Data Science, Data Engineering and Machine Learning. I was a Data Engineer intern at Amazon where I worked on building an anomaly detection framework from scratch for Amazon Video Shopping Experience
during the summer of 2023. You can know more about my projects and work from my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ishan-palit-b117a155/) account.

As a Teaching Assistant, I enjoy teaching the finer mathematical aspects of Machine Learning and look forward to answering questions of students.

Apart from work, I am an avid movie buff and enjoy music.
