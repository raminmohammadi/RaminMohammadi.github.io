I am a second year masterâ€™s student in the Data Analytics Engineering program at Northeastern University. I have previously worked as a Data Science & Analytics Associate at PwC India in multiple projects spanning Data Science, Data Engineering and Machine Learning. I am currently a Data Engineer intern at Amazon where I am working on building an anomaly detection framework from scratch for Amazon Live. You can know more about my projects and work from my <a href = "https://www.linkedin.com/in/ishan-palit-b117a155/">LinkedIn</a> account.

As a Teaching Assistant, I enjoy teaching the finer mathematical aspects of Machine Learning and look forward to answering questions of students. 

Apart from work, I am an avid movie buff and enjoy music.
