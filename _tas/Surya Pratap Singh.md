Working with data has always been interesting, piquing my interest. It was back in 2019 when I worked on my first machine-learning research project during my 2nd year of bachelor's, which motivated me to do more in this field of Data Science. I have worked on several machine learning projects in the healthcare/ agriculture/ finance domain. As a result, I am a Google Scholar with several international research publications in this field.

My academic background includes a bachelor’s degree in computer science and engineering from India, and I am currently in the final year of pursuing a master’s degree in data analytics engineering at Northeastern University, Boston. Beyond the academic realm, I have a keen interest in traveling and discovering new destinations.

I am thrilled to contribute as a Teaching Assistant for the Statistical Learning for Engineering course in Spring 2024. My anticipation extends to the prospect of establishing connections with diverse individuals, sharing insights, and embracing continuous learning opportunities.
