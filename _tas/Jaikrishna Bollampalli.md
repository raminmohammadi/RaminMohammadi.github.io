I am a Masters student in Software Engineering Systems at Northeastern University with a diverse background and a deep passion for technology. My interests span across various domains including security, AI, machine learning, privacy, cloud-native technologies, and programming.

With about 4 years of experience in the field, including a notable stint as a Senior Product Security Engineer at Logitech, I've developed a comprehensive understanding of product security, encompassing both theoretical knowledge and hands-on experience in implementing robust security measures. Concurrently with my masters, I am engaged as a Graduate Research Assistant, focusing on cybersecurity and open-source software as part of the Sovereign Tech Fund's Bug Resilience Project.

Beyond technology, I find joy in swimming, cooking, and embarking on adventures to explore new places and cuisines. I am excited to be part of Professor Ramin's MLOps course and eager to contribute to the learning journey ahead.
