Hey there! I'm Aadit, a Master's student in Software Engineering Systems at Northeastern.  I'm all about learning new things and breaking down complex concepts – the simpler I can explain something, the better I understand it myself!

Ready to dive into the world of MLOps? I'm super excited to be your guide as a graduate assistant. Before this, I was an electrical engineer turned self-taught coder. I've built my experience with ETL, web development, deployment, you name it – all fueled by my time at a startup called Loyalty Juggernaut.

When I'm not geeking out, I'm either hunting down the best eats or hitting the gym for some stress relief. Feel free to reach out on Teams or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aadit-samir-shah/).  We can tackle MLOps together, find a killer workout routine, or just chat!
