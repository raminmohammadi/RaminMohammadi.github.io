I am currently pursuing a Master's degree in Computer Science at Northeastern University, with a strong passion for delving deep into the intricacies of Machine Learning and data orchestration.

As a graduate teaching assistant for an MLOps course, I'm genuinely thrilled to be part of this educational journey. Prior to this role, I gained valuable experience as a Data Engineer at Tiger Analytics, where I honed my skills for two years. Additionally, I have a keen interest in expanding my knowledge by avidly reading technical blogs authored by reputable companies, as they provide valuable insights into industry best practices.

I'd love to engage in conversations about exciting machine learning advancements, and data engineering, exchange suggestions for great places to explore near Boston, and opportunities for future partnerships. I enjoy discovering and interacting with locales throughout the vibrant city of Boston.
