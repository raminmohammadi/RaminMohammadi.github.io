I now have a Master's Degree in Data Analytics Engineering, Yayy !! 

Graduated in May 2023. I took the Machine Learning course, now known as the Statistical Learning in Engineering in Summer 2021. Since then, I had the opportunity to serve as the TA for the course for the next 5 semesters. Worked as a Data Scientist at Quality Kiosk Technologies for a couple of years, then, as a Data Science Coop at Tausight and currently serving as Cloud Software Engineer at Trilagen.
