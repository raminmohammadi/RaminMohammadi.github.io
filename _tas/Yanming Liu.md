If you were to ask me to describe the ideal data scientist, I would describe someone who possesses a unique research viewpoint, great analytical skills, a generous sharing attitude, and a lifetime learning mindset. 

I began my new graduate career in Data Analytics Engineering at Northeastern University after completing the first master's program in Mechanical Engineering at Shandong University. My potential research lies in improvement of dialogue systems through deep reinforcement learning in near future. The expected outcome would be a generic assistant or chat-bot that can teach the knowledge and accompany people in a personalized and empathetic style. Here is my <a href="https://mingofhope.github.io/Jemdoc-Whispering-Angel-Rose.github.io/">personal website</a>, which is currently under construction.
