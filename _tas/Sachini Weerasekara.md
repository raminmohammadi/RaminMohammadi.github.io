I'm a researcher, a third-year Ph.D. student in Industrial Engineering, passionate about enabling a circular economy through Artificial Intelligence. I work on cutting-edge applications of Deep Reinforcement
Learning for remanufacturing, to help make remanufacturing cost efficient. Previously, I worked in a couple of Business Intelligence roles where I developed my interest to become an AI researcher. During
my free time, I enjoy traveling, cooking (mainly Sri Lankan food, but I love to try different cuisines from around the world), dancing and knitting.

I'm excited to be working as a Teaching Assistant for IE 7300 Statistical Learning for Engineering this Fall. Please feel free to reach out to me on MS Teams or via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sachini-weerasekara-4b95579a/), anytime.
