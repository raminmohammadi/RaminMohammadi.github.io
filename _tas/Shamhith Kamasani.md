I am a final-year Data Analytics Engineering student, deeply interested in Generative AI, MLOps, and entrepreneurial ventures. I recently completed a co-op at FM Mutual Insurance as a Generative AI Engineer, where I focused on building an LLM application for Prescriptive Maintenance using tools like AWS Sagemaker, Bedrock, and Promptflow. I’m always open to new ideas and collaboration—brainstorming, startup ventures, or hands-on product development, feel free to reach out on Teams or by email (kamasani.s@northeastern.edu). I'm also down for photo walks, basketball, and poker.
