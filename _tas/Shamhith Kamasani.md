I\'m a final year Data Analytics Engineering grad student, glad to be a
Teaching Assistant under Prof. Ramin Mohammadi, Ph.D. I had a great time
with 7300; I hope you all enjoy it too. I look forward to learning more
while helping you. You can reach out to me on Teams or mail me anytime.
I will assist you to my best. I\'m also down for writing blogs,
basketball & poker.
