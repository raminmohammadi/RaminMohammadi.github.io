I'm a master's student in Information Systems at Northeastern, and I'm passionate about Machine Learning. I love digging into the technical details of ML, and I spend my free time exploring new restaurants and places in Boston.

Right now, I'm a graduate teaching assistant for an MLOps course, and I'm excited to be a part of it! Before that, I was a Senior ML Engineer at Standard Chartered Bank in India for 2.5 years. I also enjoy reading technical blogs from established companies to learn about best practices.

Feel free to reach out to me on Teams or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dhanushkumarshankar/) and we can discuss exciting ML developments, share Boston food recommendations, or simply connect for future collaborations.
