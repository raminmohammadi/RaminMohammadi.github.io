I am a dynamic, analytical data professional with experience in database design  and proficient utilization of analytics tools who joined Northeastern  University in 2020. Having been working for a consulting company  and dealing with ad-hoc client requests, I built up proven capability  to manage projects from business requirements and data modeling, followed by precise analytics phase, to insightful results that contributes 
to  the corporate benefits. 

My interested topics include Recommender System, and database schema design in  business scenarios. Apart from data, I'm a home brewer (ale and cider), 
a violin player, an undiagnosed OCD patient, a Roman-wannabe.
