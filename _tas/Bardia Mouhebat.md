I am a graduate student at Northeastern University pursuing my Master's in Data Analytics Engineering. This is my fourth semester at Northeastern and I am currently working at National Grid as a Data Analyst Coop.

I am passionate about Data Science and enjoy improving my knowledge in this field with a focus on Machine Learning and Statistics. My other interests include playing tennis, playing soccer, and working out.

I am extremely excited to be part of the Teaching Assistant team for IE7300 Statistical Learning in Engineering under supervision of Professor Ramin Mohammadi. Please feel free to reach out to me with any queries.
