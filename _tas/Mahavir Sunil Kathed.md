I'm a Master's student in Industrial Engineering at Northeastern University with a keen interest in Data Science and Machine Learning, especially in healthcare and manufacturing domain. With over three years of experience as a Reliability and Maintenance Engineer at Reliance Industries Limited, India, I've successfully implemented various statistical techniques in multiple projects.

I am glad to be a teaching assistant under Prof. Ramin Mohammadi for IE7300: Statistical Learning for Engineering course. I'm open to collaborations and discussions in the fields of industrial engineering, data science, and machine learning. Please feel free to reach out to me for course guidance or project collaborations.
