I am a final-year Data Analytics Engineering graduate student glad to work as a Teaching Assistant under Prof. Mohammadi Ramin Ph.D. I'm passionate for applying machine learning to real-world manufacturing challenges like failure prediction and quality control. I believe my academic focus can be of value to your learning journey. Whether you seek help on concepts, assignments, or navigating machine learning, I am always happy to help. I look forward to furthering our mutual understanding through collaborative discussions. Please reach out for brainstorming, project help, or a friendly post-class table tennis match!
