<p>Hi thereðŸ‘‹, I'm Akhil. </p>

<p>I'm an M.S. DAE graduate (May 2023). After a gratifying academic journey, I re-joined <a href="https://www.tausight.com/">Tausight Inc.</a> as an ML & MLOps Intern. I'm pursuing the career path of a Machine Learning Engineer. To know more about my professional work, please check out my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/akhilesh1896/">LinkedIn</a>.</p>

<p>I worked as a TA for this course for 5 consecutive semesters during which I had a great time teaching Python, interacting with students for their questions, publishing blogs and developing this website. Have a question? Please feel free to reach out to <a href = "mailto:ande.s@northeastern.edu">me</a>. Let's solve it together!!</p>

<p>Apart from academics, I spend my casual time in playing video games(DotA 2), learning photography, cooking(Indian Cuisine), watching animae and tv shows.</p>

<p><b>p.s.</b> I highly recommend checking out the tv show "Person of Interest" (2011). It greatly inspired my journey into AI and remains my all-time favorite.</p>
