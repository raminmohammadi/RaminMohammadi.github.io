Hi, I am Ramin Mohammadi PhD, AI enthusiastic and Machine Learning 
researcher. I enjoy helping engineers like you to learn and build up a career 
path in this amazing domain. 

## Personal life
I enjoy outdoor activities and spending time with **Family**, our dog Leo 
and our cat Bumper. I love sports and am a calisthenic athlete. I play 
Tennis, Basketball, running, Snowboarding and trying to pick up surfing 
these days. I love indoor gardening and have a plant collection.


## Primarily Work:
I am AI/ML lead at [Tausight](https://www.tausight.com/) 
with a focus of applying deep learning, classical machine learning and 
natural language processing to cyber-security domain. 


## Teaching:
I am an adjunct professor at [Northeastern University](https://raminmohammadi.sites.northeastern.edu/), College of Engineering
* IE 7300 - Statistical Learning for Engineering
* IE 7374 - ST : Machine Learning Operations (MLOps)
* IE 7374 - ST : Machine Learning For Engineering
* IE 6600 - Computation and Visualization for Analytics

I enjoy teaching and mentoring young minds and help them to understand the 
magic behind AI and teach them how to practically apply this knowledge's to 
real life problems.
