If you were to ask me to describe the ideal data scientist, I would describe someone who possesses a unique research viewpoint, great analytical skills, a generous sharing attitude, and a lifetime learning mindset. 

I began my new graduate career in Data Analytics Engineering at Northeastern University after completing the first master's program in Mechanical Engineering at Shandong University. My potential research lies in interpretable neural networks and reinforcement learning. I'm currently working on a personality-based dating app. Learn more about me on my <a href="https://mingofhope.github.io/Jemdoc-Whispering-Angel-Rose.github.io/">personal website</a>, which is currently under construction, or, if appropriate, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/yanming21/">LinkedIn</a>.
