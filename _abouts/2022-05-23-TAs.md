If you were to ask me to describe the ideal data scientist, I would describe someone who possesses a unique research viewpoint, great analytical skills, a generous sharing attitude, and a lifetime learning mindset. 

I began my new graduate career in Data Analytics Engineering at Northeastern University after completing the first master's program in Mechanical Engineering at Shandong University. My potential research lies in improvement of dialogue systems through deep reinforcement learning in near future. The expected outcome would be a generic assistant or chat-bot that can teach the knowledge and accompany people in a personalized and empathetic style. Here is my <a href="https://mingofhope.github.io/Jemdoc-Whispering-Angel-Rose.github.io/">personal website</a>, which is currently under construction.

I am a final-year graduate student enrolled in Data Analytics Engineering. Glad to work under prof Ramin Mohammadi, Ph.D. as a Machine Learning Teaching Assistant. Professorâ€™s passion in teaching helped me develop an immense interest in gaining in-depth knowledge of the subject.

Having worked as a Data Analytics Engineer in Infrastructure & Operations gave me a better perspective on analyzing data to tackle the problems effectively. I excel at leveraging data analytics and building models to drive insights for data-driven transformations. I am in the cognitive process of learning and currently working towards upskilling myself with Neural Networks and Deep Learning. Feel free to reach out to me if any queries or any project collaborations. Happy learning :)
