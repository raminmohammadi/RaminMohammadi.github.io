<h2 id="1-problem-setting">1. Problem Setting</h2>
<p>Marketing analytics is the study of data to evaluate the effectiveness of marketing initiatives.
Businesses can improve their marketing campaigns, comprehend what motivates consumer
behavior, and maximize their return on investment. In this project, we’ll examine whether a
customer bought a product as a result of some website features. From a marketing
perspective, it would be very advantageous to analyze this trend and forecast product sales
because it would assist the business in making various decisions, such as deciding whether to
stock the product or plan for discounts.</p>

<h2 id="2-project-goal">2. Project Goal</h2>
<p>A specific business that maintains a website to sell its goods in a virtual marketplace wants to
forecast when a product will be bought. Finding patterns and similarities between customers
who have purchased the product and those who have not will help us solve this issue by
grouping the two groups of customers into clusters. Numerous elements or characteristics that
the business has learned about from its website ultimately affect the customer’s choice to buy
the product. These are the variables that we intend to use to predict and build a dependency
on a purchase.</p>

<h2 id="3-data-description">3. Data Description</h2>
<p>The dataset for this project is taken from the UCI Machine Learning Repository: <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Online%2BShoppers%2BPurchasing%2BIntention%2BDataset">Online Shopper’s Purchase Intention</a>.
The dataset containing the site’s statistics is called “Online Shoppers’ Purchase Intention.”
The dataset has 18 columns__s complete, the null entries are examined first. Our dataset is found
to have no missing or null values, making it suitable for use in machine learning tasks.</p>

<p><img src="/images/Projects/group_6_fall_2022/Picture1.webp" alt="" /></p>

<h3 id="41-categorical-variables">4.1 Categorical Variables</h3>
<p>Distribution is presented for categorical variables with respect to the target variable
“Revenue” (Product bought or not). Each categorical variable’s impact on the customer’s
choice is shown. The graphs below show that the Special Day category has no bearing on the
target variable. Looking at the months, we can observe that May, November, and December
have larger sales of products than the other months, which may be related to the holiday
shopping season. Users only utilize a small number of operating systems and browsers, and
as a result, a small number of them display the target variable response. The charts below
show that regions and traffic categories 1 to 4 have the highest likelihood of making a
purchase. Compared to other visitor types, visitor type 1 has the highest conversion potential.
The graph shows that weekday users of the site had the high probability of making a
purchase, indicating that the weekend does not have a significant impact on customer
purchases.</p>

<p><img src="/images/Projects/group_6_fall_2022/Picture3.webp" alt="" /></p>

<p>We can see the percentage of clients who buy or don’t buy a product from the plot below. Our
data is very imbalanced, with more than 80% being 0 and 20% being 1.</p>

<p><img src="/images/Projects/group_6_fall_2022/Picture4.webp" alt="" /></p>

<h3 id="42-numerical-variables">4.2 Numerical Variables</h3>
<p>Summary of the numerical variables. We can see that most of the variables are right skewed.</p>

<p><img src="/images/Projects/group_6_fall_2022/Picture5.webp" alt="" /></p>

<p>Similar to how most real-world data is right skewed, boxplots are also produced for
numerical variables, showing that our data lacks a distinct center.</p>

<p><img src="/images/Projects/group_6_fall_2022/Picture6.webp" alt="" /></p>

<p>To determine the correlation between the numerical variables, we have also created a
correlation heatmap. We can see high correlation between Administrative and
Administrative_duration, Informational and Informational_duration, ProductRelated and
ProductRelated_duration, and BounceRates and ExitRates. And few columns showing
negative correlation as well.</p>

<p><img src="/images/Projects/group_6_fall_2022/Picture7.webp" alt="" /></p>

<h2 id="5-data-pre-processing">5. Data Pre-processing</h2>
<p>For the purpose of choosing features for categorical variables, the chi square test has been
used. First, the categorical data was transformed into nominal categories before the chi test
was performed. From the graph below we can he variables OperatingSystems and
TrafficType has a p value larger than 0.05, hence these variables are dropped from the
dataset.</p>

<p><img src="/images/Projects/group_6_fall_2022/Picture8.webp" alt="" /></p>

<p>Following that, we examined the skewness of the numerical variables. The majority of the
variables are clearly severely skewed, as can be seen in the table below. To fix this skewness
in the dataset, we applied the square root technique.</p>

<p>Skewness Before:</p>

<p>Following that, we removed the highly correlated columns from the dataset based on the
correlation plot. The categorical attributes were then subjected to One hot encoding, resulting
in the addition total of 47 columns. The data was divided into training (75%) and test
(25%) sets. After this, as our dataset was imbalanced, we performed SMOTE technique of
oversampling the minority class which in terms of our dataset was Revenue as 1. Then,
before employing any machine learning models, the training data was standardized. The test
data was then converted using the training data mean and standard deviation.

<h2 id="6-machine-learning-models">6. Machine Learning Models</h2>
<p>The following models have been implemented:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Logistic Regression</li>
  <li>Naïve Bayes</li>
  <li>Neural Networks</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="61-logistic-regression">6.1 Logistic regression</h3>
<p>Logistic Regression is the most common type of classification model which calculates some optimal parameters. When the input is multiplied by these learned optimal parameters, we get a binary output, 0 or 1 in this case.</p>

<p><img src="/images/Projects/group_6_fall_2022/Picture11.webp" alt="" /></p>

<p>The model’s performance is determined by the cost function. It is employed to gauge how
closely the model’s predictions match the actual results. The cost can be computed
numerically as follows for specific “m” observations:</p>

<p><img src="/images/Projects/group_6_fall_2022/Picture12.webp" alt="" /></p>

<p>Then, we used the following parameters to train our model: Maximum iterations are 5000,
Tolerance is 0.00005, and Alpha is 0.00001.
Below is the graph that was produced by the gradient descent algorithm. As the number of
iterations rises, the error is depicted on the graph.</p>

<p><img src="/images/Projects/group_6_fall_2022/Picture13.webp" alt="" /></p>

<p>We estimated the result for training error using the weights, and we calculated cutoff vs
sensitivity/accuracy to select the best cutoff. These are the outcomes:</p>

<p>In order to achieve a better balance between sensitivity and accuracy, we choose to utilize a
cutoff of 0.4. The following outcomes are obtained after applying our trained model to our
testset:</p>

<h3 id="62-gaussian-naïve-bayes">6.2 Gaussian Naïve Bayes</h3>
<p>The Gaussian Naive Bayes model classifies a new data point based on the data available. It is the simplest type of model where the calculations are based on probabilities and likelihoods.</p>

<p>The following is the Bayes Theorem calculation in its simplest version. Where the marginal
probability of the occurrence P(A) is referred to as the prior and the probability that we are
interested in computing P(A|B) is called the posterior probability.</p>

<h4 id="pab--pba--pa--pb"><strong>P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)</strong></h4>

<p>The likelihood of a predictor for a given class is its probability. The number of examples
(rows) in the training dataset divided by the proportion of observations with the class label
can be used to determine the prior.</p>

<h4 id="pyi--examples-with-yi--total-example"><strong>P(yi) = examples with yi / total example</strong></h4>

<p>To determine if the model is overfitting or not, we trained the priors for the training set and
produced predictions for both the training and test sets.</p>

<h3 id="63-neural-networks">6.3 Neural Networks</h3>
<p>A neural network model tries to imitate the human brain. There are layers of neurons , which are essentially gates where some calculation takes place. Each neuron has a weight and a bias.</p>

<p>Mathematically the calculation at a node is given by:</p>

<h4 id="a1--wixi--bi-where-wi-is-weight-and-bi-is-bias"><strong>a1 = wi*xi + bi, where wi is weight and bi is bias</strong></h4>

<p>The procedure of back propagation is used to calculate the gradient of neural network
parameters. The method essentially traverses the network from the output to the input layer in
reverse order using the chain rule from calculus to update weights and biases thereby introducing learning factor in the model.</p>

<p>The error function’s gradient with regard to the weights and biases is calculated,</p>

<p><img src="/images/Projects/group_6_fall_2022/Picture18.webp" alt="" /></p>

<p>The mean squared error serves as the error function in traditional backpropagation.</p>

<p>With two hidden layers (16, 8) and an output layer with a sigmoid activation function, we created neural networks using Keras. We used relu for the hidden layer’s activation function, the Adam optimizer for loss, and binary cross entropy loss for loss. We ran the model for 100 epochs and observed that the training accuracy and validation accuracy were almost at constant values.</p>

<h4 id="training-accuracy-vs-validation-accuracy">Training accuracy vs validation accuracy</h4>

<p><img src="/images/Projects/group_6_fall_2022/Picture23.webp" width="500px" /></p>

<p>The validation accuracy is lower than the training accuracy indicating that the model is
overfitting on training data. To solve this problem , we tried to implement regularization
techniques in Neural Network by adding a L2 norm and dropout layers. Although it did not
affect the accuracy scores, it did lower the accuracy of model on testing data which is
undesirable.</p>

<h2 id="7-results">7. Results</h2>
<p>Since the goal of our model is to determine the likelihood that a customer would purchase a
product, we must trade off poor specificity for higher accuracy and sensitivity. Classifying a
product’s likelihood of purchase is crucial in order to decide whether to invest in targeted
marketing initiatives, among other things. Reaching them through marketing may result in
more income, even if some consumers who are not going to buy are recognized as potential
customers. However, we risk losing potential customer if we incorrectly categorize the
