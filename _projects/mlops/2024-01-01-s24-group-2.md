## 1. Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

### 1.1. Problem Statement

The project aims to tackle the challenge of enhancing the relevance and contextual precision of AI-powered chatbots by integrating the **[Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)](https://youtu.be/T-D1OfcDW1M?feature=shared)** framework on Azure Databricks. Traditional chatbots often face difficulties delivering accurate responses due to hallucination issues, limitations in accessing relevant external information and dynamically updating content. To address this, our solution incorporates continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) processes for rapid updates, utilizes Delta Tables for secure data storage, and leverages serverless architecture for scalability. 

### 1.2. Methodology

1. **Framework Integration and Setup:**
    - **RAG Implementation:** We begin by integrating the  **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** framework into our chatbot system. This involves configuring the RAG model to query a Delta Table-stored knowledge base, enabling the chatbot to pull relevant information in real time to enhance the accuracy and relevance of its responses.
    - **Azure Databricks Configuration:** Implementing advanced vector search techniques to improve the speed and accuracy of document segment retrieval. Utilizing **Unity Catalog** on **Azure Databricks** to build an infrastructure to deploy the chatbot and manage data storage(ADLS Gen 2) and pre-processing.
2. **Data:**
    - **Delta Tables:** Implement Delta Tables to manage the data layer. This setup ensures ACID transactions and optimized metadata handling for our large datasets, facilitating secure, scalable, and efficient data storage and retrieval.
    - **Data Pre-processing:** The input data is in the form of PDFs/Text which is then chunked and transformed into vector embeddings using a large language model such as **Llama-2, GPT-3.5**, etc. and stored in Delta Tables on Azure(**ADLS Gen 2**) for efficient retrieval and management.
3. **Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD):**
    - **Development Pipeline:** Establish a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions on Azure Databricks. This pipeline automates the dev, stage and production workflow, enabling continuous updates and integration without downtime or disruptions.
    - **Automated Testing:** Integrate comprehensive automated unit and integration tests to validate the functionality and performance of the chatbot at various stages of the deployment pipeline.
4. **Lifecycle Management with MLFlow:**
    - **Model Tracking:** Utilize MLFlow for tracking experiments, managing the lifecycle of the machine learning models, and documenting the performance across different iterations, adding model version rollback.
    - **Model Evaluation:** Leverage MLFlow’s capabilities to evaluate the performance of the RAG model systematically, using custom metrics tailored to assess the relevance and accuracy of the chatbot’s responses.
5. **Monitoring and Cost Analysis:**
    - **Performance Monitoring:** Implement lakehouse monitoring to continuously assess the system's performance and health. This includes tracking usage metrics, response times, and accuracy of responses.
    - **Cost Analysis:** In the end, we have provided a thorough cost analysis of the entire project setup.

### 1.3. Goals

The goals of this project comprised of the following:
- **Test-Driven Development (TDD):** Ensure the robustness and reliability of the chatbot system through TDD practices.
- **Orchestrating the Data Pipeline:** Use MLflow to manage and automate the data pipeline.
- **Data Versioning:** Implement DVC for versioning the transformed data.
- **Model Versioning and Hyperparameter Tuning:** Utilize MLFlow for versioning the models and tuning hyperparameters to optimize model performance.
- **Model Deployment:** Deploy the model using a scalable and robust serverless architecture.
- **Monitoring Data and Concept Drifts:** Implement a monitoring dashboard to track data and detect concept drifts, ensuring the model remains relevant and accurate over time.
- **Maintaining CI/CD Process:** Use Pytest and GitHub Actions to maintain a seamless CI/CD process, ensuring continuous integration and deployment without disruptions.

This project serves as a simulation for real-world applications in the competitive business landscape. Future applications include enhancing customer interactions and satisfaction through AI-driven chatbots with high relevance and contextual precision.
